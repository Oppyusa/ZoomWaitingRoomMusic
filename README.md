# ZoomWaitingRoomMusic
Have you ever wanted to have the Jeopardy Theme song play on an endless loop while your waiting for the host to allow you to join the call?
No? While I certianly joked about this on my Discord server, took the joke way to serously, and made a program to actually do this.

Is it at all useful? No. 
Is it funny? I think so.
